# USGS Leaflet Visualization

### Background
This project uses weekly significant earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to build an interactive global map in Leaflet.js. This map focuses on three main properties of each earthquake:
- The location of each earthquake, represented by a circular marker of various sizes and colors,
- The magnitude of each earthquake, represented by the radius of each marker,
- The depth of each earthquake, represented by the color of each marker.

### Dependencies
- Leaflet.js javascript and CSS files
- d3.js javascript
- config.js file with Mapbox API key

### Resources
- USGS Earthquake API (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
- Mapbox Tilesets
